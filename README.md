# Traffic light test

This is a test application in C++. In this project I'm trying multi-class projects as well as some basic logic for a simple 4-way traffic light.
The plan is to expand upon this with a more decoupled strategy of more complex traffic lights, such as 4 way traffic lights with pedestrian+bicycle crossing,
4 way traffic light with left-turns and 5 way traffic lights.

Some kind of fall-back system is planned, a so call "yellow light" system.

## Planned for self contained embedded
This system is planned to be condensed to a simple embedded system on an STM32-architecture in the future.
As of now, I lack space on a desk to solve the soldering situation..
